                                    <p class="bio-paragraph">I am a software developer formed from a melting pot of business and design backgrounds. I began my career as a graphic designer for a clothing company. After a few years of designing for said company, I decided to take a shot at making my own label. I built the company from the ground up by handling every aspect of the business from design, to manufacturing and sales. To save on money and maintain quality control, I built a custom printing facility and taught myself how to print with quality. I made it to a point where I was proclaimed the "future of the streetwear industry" by Bobby Hundreds of the Hundreds, but by this point, I found my true passion. I found that I loved to learn and build things. Nothing is more empowering than creating something that didn't exist before you gave it life. A few of my collegues suggested development a couple of years back. I checked it out, and the rest is history. </p>
